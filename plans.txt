INITIAL MVP GOAL: 
Player character can move around, catch a Pokemon or get one from the professor, 
and fight an NPC (probably their rival)

-----------------JAVASCRIPT-----------------------------
[] Place Items
    [] Player Character
    [] NPCs
    [] Interactable objects
    [] Background/Map

[] Move Player Character
    [] Player character moves when arrow keys are pressed
    [] Player character has appropriate walking sprite when moving
        (different sprite rotations)

[] Interact with World
    [] When player presses button (spacebar?) they can...
        [] Talk to NPC
        [] Pick up an item (mostly for when player chooses their first Pokemon)
        [] Interact with object? MAYBE if there's time. This, for example, 
        is when the player interacts with something like a bookcase, and there
        is a dialogue pop up that might mention a book on the shelf. Could be
        fun easter eggs with this.

[] Continue Dialogue
    [] When an NPC says their line, there will be a stop, and
    the player must press the Enter button to make the NPC keep talking
    [] This applies to interacting with objects too. Press Enter to make the dialogue continue/end.

[] Enter Building (or new place)
    [] When player walks through door or entrance, the screen
    will go black, and then load the new location

[] Collision Detection
    [] If player walks into an object (that is not an entrance), they stop moving
    [] Could be a bump sound effect

[] Set Battle
    [] Sets battle scene background
    [] Sets the patches of grass or whatever that the Pokemon stand on

[] Battle NPC (not done yet)
    [] Battle NPC Dialogue:
        { NPC NAME } wants to battle!
        (player presses Enter to continue)
        { NPC NAME } sent out { NPC POKEMON }!
        Go! { PLAYER POKEMON }!
        What will { PLAYER POKEMON } do?
